About me and this project
Hi. So, I was able to install macOS Mojave. Almost everything works. I saw a post on Reddit about how someone installed macOS Mojave on HP ProBook 450 G5 and magically everything worked on Vanilla installation and he didnâ€™t want to help other people with installation, so I felt bad for others. I take my self for very persistent person and I decided to install macOS Mojave on my laptop and share it with you guys. I am programmer, I work with computers for my whole life and things like this are no issue for me to achieve, I just need some time to figure them out and perfect them. 
Hope you appreciate my donation to the community and that you really read everything ðŸ˜Š
